# COINCO

A 2d scroller/visual novel game, where you play as a retired coin collector on a final quest to finish his collection.
Made using godot (plugins: Dialogic)

**Game includes:**
- Player movement
- NPCs (that you can interact with) and amazing dialogue
- A story (not finished)

Second time making a game so it's very scuffed.
